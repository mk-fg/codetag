# List of filters for paths to crawl and files to tag
filter:
  # Go regexp patterns to match relative (to source.path, starting with "/") paths to tag.
  # Patterns are matched against each path in order they're listed here.
  # Each pattern must start with "+" or "-", "+" meaning that matched path will
  #  be tagged/traversed and "-" for the opposite.
  # Leaf directories are matched with the trailing slash
  #  (as with rsync) to be distinguishable from files with the same name.
  # If path doesn't match any regexp on the list, it will be tagged.
  # Excluded directories won't be traversed.
  # Go/re2 regexp syntax ref: https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax
  # Enclose regexps in single quotes to make sure "-regexp" won't be interpreted as yaml list.
  #
  # Examples:
  #  - '+/\.git/config$'   # tag git repository config files
  #  - '-/\.git/.'   # *don't* tag any repository objects
  #  - '-/\.(hg|bzr|redo)/'  # these won't be traversed at all
  #  - '-(?i)/\.?svn(/|ignore)$'   # exclude svn (or .svn) paths (case-insensitive) and ignore-lists

  - '+/\.git/config$'
  - '-/\.git/.'
  - '-/\.(hg|bzr|redo)/'
  - '-(?i)/\.?svn(/|ignore)$'


# Taggers are configurable plugins that return a string tag for a file,
#  given it's location. What they do to that path (or files) is plugin-specific.
# "taggers" should be a map, with tag namespace (e.g. "lang" part in "lang:py")
#  as a key and either scalar plugin name or map with "name: config..." as value.
# Special-case namespace "_none" can be used to use returned tags w/o prefix.
# Universally-recognized "fallback" config value, if set to "true", will make
#  tagger run only if previous taggers haven't added anything to the same namespace.
